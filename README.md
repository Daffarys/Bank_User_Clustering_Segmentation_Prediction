# Bank User Clustering Segmentation Prediction
## Overview
Welcome to the Bank User Clustering Segmentation Prediction project! This data analysis project focuses on creating machine learning models to cluster bank users based on their behavior and banking activities. The primary goal is to facilitate customer segmentation, enabling stakeholders to tailor activities and promotions. This, in turn, optimizes resource allocation, improves product development, and promotes data-driven decision-making within the banking domain.

## Project Date
August 2023

## Project Objectives
- Customer Segmentation: Implement machine learning models to categorize bank users into distinct segments based on their behavior and activities.

- Resource Allocation Optimization: Enable stakeholders to allocate resources efficiently by understanding the distinct needs and preferences of different user segments.

- Product Development Enhancement: Provide insights for product development teams to create and enhance banking products that align with customer preferences.

- Data-Driven Decision Making: Foster a culture of data-driven decision-making by leveraging insights derived from the analysis and clustering of bank user data.

## Technology and Tools
- Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Employed for numerical operations and array handling.
- Seaborn and Matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization to gain insights into user behavior and trends.
- Scikit-Learn: Applied for implementing machine learning models for user segmentation.
